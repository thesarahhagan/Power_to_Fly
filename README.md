# Abstract
With ever-increasing stress in the workplace and a global pandemic, many individuals are suffering from work-related fatigue and exhaustion, otherwise known as burnout. But how can we treat burnout, or even avoid it entirely? This talk will focus on how to identify the characteristics of workplace burnout, advice for how to deal with it when you have it, and practical tips to create a better work-life "balance" to avoid burnout.
